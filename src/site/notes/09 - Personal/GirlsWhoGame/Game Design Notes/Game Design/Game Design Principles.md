This note will serve as a repository for various game design principles and concepts.

## Core Principles

*   **Fun:** The ultimate goal is to create an enjoyable experience. Fun is subjective, but it often involves challenge, reward, novelty, and social interaction.
*   **Clarity:** Players should understand the rules, goals, and consequences of their actions. Avoid ambiguity and ensure intuitive mechanics.
*   **Engagement:** Keep the player interested and motivated. This can be achieved through compelling narratives, satisfying progression, and meaningful choices.
*   **Balance:** Ensure that all elements of the game are fair and harmonious. This includes character abilities, resource allocation, and difficulty levels.
*   **Accessibility:** Make the game playable by a wide range of players, regardless of their skill level or physical abilities. Consider options for difficulty scaling, control customization, and visual/auditory adjustments.

## Specific Concepts

### The Core Loop

*   The fundamental cycle of actions that players repeat throughout the game. Examples:
    *   **First-Person Shooter:** Explore -> Encounter Enemy -> Shoot -> Loot -> Repeat
    *   **RPG:** Accept Quest -> Explore -> Fight Monsters -> Gain Experience/Loot -> Return Quest -> Repeat

### Reward Systems

*   How the game incentivizes player actions.  Types of rewards:
    *   **Intrinsic:** The joy of playing the game itself.
    *   **Extrinsic:** Points, items, achievements, or social recognition.
*   **Variable Ratio Reinforcement:**  Rewarding players after a variable number of actions. This is considered highly effective in keeping players engaged (think loot boxes).

### Difficulty Scaling

*   Adjusting the challenge level to suit different players.
*   Methods:
    *   **Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA):** The game automatically adjusts difficulty based on player performance.
    *   **Difficulty Settings:** Players choose a difficulty level at the start of the game.

### Player Agency

*   The player's ability to make meaningful choices that impact the game world.
*   High agency leads to greater player investment and a sense of ownership.

### Level Design

*   The art and science of creating compelling and functional game environments.
*   Considerations:
    *   **Navigation:** Clear pathways and intuitive layouts.
    *   **Pacing:** Alternating between moments of high intensity and periods of rest.
    *   **Visual Storytelling:** Using the environment to convey narrative information.

### Game Feel

*   The subjective sensation of interacting with the game.
*   Factors that contribute to good game feel:
    *   **Responsiveness:** Actions are immediately reflected in the game world.
    *   **Juice:** Visual and auditory feedback that enhances the impact of actions.
    *   **Polish:** Refinement of all aspects of the game to create a smooth and satisfying experience.

## Questions to Consider During Design

*   Who is the target audience?
*   What is the core gameplay loop?
*   What are the key mechanics and how do they interact?
*   What are the potential challenges and how can they be addressed?
*   How will the game be balanced and fair?
*   How will the game be made accessible to a wide range of players?
