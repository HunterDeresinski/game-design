This note serves as a living document for collecting and referencing best practices in level design.

## Core Principles

*   **Gameplay First:** Level design should always serve the gameplay. The environment should enhance and facilitate the intended player experience.
*   **Clarity and Readability:** The player should be able to easily understand the level's layout, objectives, and potential paths. Avoid unnecessary visual clutter and prioritize clear visual cues.
*   **Fun and Engagement:** Above all, the level should be fun and engaging to play. Experiment with different mechanics, challenges, and rewards to keep players motivated.
*   **Player Agency:** Offer players choices and options in how they approach challenges. Empower them to make decisions and feel like they have control over their experience.

## Key Considerations

*   **Flow and Pacing:**
    *   **Flow:** Design the level to guide players smoothly from one area to another, minimizing backtracking and confusion. Use landmarks, lighting, and subtle environmental cues to direct the player's attention.
    *   **Pacing:** Vary the intensity of gameplay. Alternate between periods of high action, exploration, and quieter moments of reflection.
*   **Navigation and Wayfinding:**
    *   **Landmarks:** Use distinct and memorable landmarks to help players orient themselves and remember locations.
    *   **Lighting:** Utilize lighting to guide players and create atmosphere. Bright areas can draw attention, while darker areas can create tension or mystery.
    *   **Color Coding:** Use color to highlight important elements, such as interactable objects or pathways.
    *   **Signposting:** Provide clear visual cues, such as arrows, symbols, or environmental details, to indicate the correct path.
*   **Challenge and Reward:**
    *   **Gradual Difficulty Curve:** Introduce new mechanics and challenges gradually, allowing players to learn and master them before facing more complex situations.
    *   **Meaningful Rewards:** Provide players with rewards that are valuable and satisfying, such as new abilities, equipment, or story progression.
    *   **Hidden Areas and Secrets:** Encourage exploration by hiding optional areas and secrets that offer additional rewards or challenges.
*   **Environmental Storytelling:**
    *   **Visual Details:** Use environmental details, such as worn furniture, graffiti, or abandoned objects, to tell a story about the level's history and inhabitants.
    *   **Atmosphere:** Create a believable and immersive atmosphere through the use of lighting, sound, and environmental effects.

## Practical Techniques

*   **Paper Prototyping:** Sketch out the level's layout and gameplay flow on paper before creating it in a game engine.
*   **Greyboxing:** Create a rough, blocky version of the level to test the basic layout and gameplay mechanics before adding detailed art assets.
*   **Playtesting:** Regularly test the level with real players to gather feedback and identify areas for improvement.
*   **Iterative Design:** Be willing to iterate on the level based on playtesting feedback. Don't be afraid to make significant changes to the layout or gameplay if necessary.

## Specific Level Types (To Expand Upon)

*   **Combat Arenas:** Design for strategic cover, flanking routes, and varied enemy encounters.
*   **Puzzle Rooms:** Focus on clear communication of the puzzle's rules and satisfying solutions.
*   **Exploration Zones:** Encourage curiosity and reward thorough exploration with hidden secrets and environmental storytelling.
*   **Platforming Sections:** Prioritize precise controls and clear visual cues for jumps and obstacles.

## Tools and Resources

*   **Game Engines:** (Unity, Unreal Engine, etc.)
*   **Level Design Software:** (Hammer, TrenchBroom, etc.)
*   **Online Communities:** (Level Design subreddit, etc.)
*   **Game Design Books:** (e.g., *Level Up! The Guide to Great Video Game Design*)

## Things to Avoid

*   **Dead Ends:** Unless intentionally used for dramatic effect or hidden rewards, avoid creating dead ends that can frustrate players.
*   **Repetitive Environments:** Avoid using the same assets and layouts too often, as this can make the level feel monotonous.
*   **Unclear Objectives:** Make sure that the player always knows what they are supposed to be doing and where they are supposed to be going.
*   **Unfair Challenges:** Avoid creating challenges that are too difficult or that rely on trial and error.
