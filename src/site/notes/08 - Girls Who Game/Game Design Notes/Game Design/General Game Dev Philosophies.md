# General Game Dev Philosophies

This note aims to collect and organize general game development philosophies, principles, and "rules of thumb" that can guide the development process. It's a living document that will evolve as I learn and experience more. If you guy's have any questions or tips for additions feel free to let me know

## Core Principles

*   **Fun is King:** The primary goal of a game is to be enjoyable. All design decisions should be evaluated based on how they contribute to the overall fun factor. If it's not fun, cut it or iterate on it.

*   **Iterate Early, Iterate Often:** Build prototypes and quickly test core mechanics. Get feedback early and often. Don't be afraid to scrap ideas that aren't working. The faster you iterate, the faster you'll find the fun.

*   **Focus on the Core Loop:** Identify the core loop (the fundamental action-reward cycle) of your game and nail it. Everything else should support and enhance that core loop. Make the core loop satisfying and engaging.

*   **Polish Matters:** Small details and polish can significantly impact the player experience. Visual feedback, sound effects, and smooth animations all contribute to a feeling of quality.

*   **Know Your Audience:** Design your game with a specific target audience in mind. Understanding their preferences, expectations, and skill levels will help you make informed design decisions.

*   **Simplicity is Key:** Avoid unnecessary complexity. Focus on creating a clear and concise experience that is easy to understand and engaging to play. Over-complicated systems can overwhelm players.

## Design Philosophies

*   **"Easy to Learn, Difficult to Master":** A good game is accessible to new players but offers depth and challenge for experienced players.

*   **Juice It Up:** Add visual and auditory feedback to actions to make them feel more impactful and satisfying. This includes things like screen shake, particle effects, and impactful sound design.

*   **Show, Don't Tell:** Avoid lengthy tutorials and exposition dumps. Instead, teach players through gameplay and environmental storytelling.

*   **Player Agency:** Give players meaningful choices and allow them to express themselves within the game world.

*   **Positive Feedback Loops:** Design systems that reward players for engaging with the game. This can be through experience points, loot, or other forms of progression.

## Development Philosophies

*   **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):** Avoid over-engineering solutions. Start with the simplest possible implementation and add complexity only when necessary.

*   **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Avoid duplicating code. Use functions, classes, and other techniques to reuse code and reduce redundancy.

*   **Premature Optimization is the Root of All Evil:** Don't optimize code until you have identified performance bottlenecks. Focus on writing clear and maintainable code first.

*   **Version Control is Your Friend:** Use version control (e.g., Git) to track changes to your code and collaborate with others.

*   **Document Everything:** Document your code, designs, and processes. This will make it easier for you and others to understand and maintain the project.

## Production Philosophies

*   **Scope Creep is the Enemy:** Avoid adding features that are not essential to the core experience. Focus on delivering a polished and complete game within a defined scope.

*   **Timeboxing:** Allocate specific amounts of time to tasks to prevent them from dragging on indefinitely.

*   **Regular Playtesting:** Conduct regular playtesting sessions to gather feedback and identify issues.

*   **Communication is Crucial:** Maintain open and honest communication within the development team.

This is a work in progress.  I will continue to add and refine these philosophies as I learn more.
