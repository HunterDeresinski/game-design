## Definition

Behavioral economics is a field that studies the effects of psychological, cognitive, emotional, cultural and social factors on the economic decisions of individuals and institutions and how those decisions vary from those implied by classical economic theory. It integrates insights from psychology, neuroscience, and economics to provide a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of human behavior in economic contexts.

## Key Concepts

*   **Cognitive Biases:** Systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment.
    *   **Anchoring Bias:** Relying too heavily on the first piece of information offered (the "anchor") when making decisions.
    *   **Availability Heuristic:** Overestimating the likelihood of events that are readily available in memory (e.g., due to media coverage).
    *   **Confirmation Bias:** Seeking out information that confirms existing beliefs while ignoring contradictory evidence.
    *   **Loss Aversion:** Feeling the pain of a loss more strongly than the pleasure of an equivalent gain.
    *   **Framing Effect:** How choices are presented influences decisions, even if the underlying options are the same.
    *   **Endowment Effect:** Valuing something more simply because you own it.
*   **Heuristics:** Mental shortcuts or rules of thumb that simplify decision-making, often leading to biases.
*   **Prospect Theory:** A behavioral economic theory that describes how people make choices involving risk and uncertainty. It highlights loss aversion and the framing effect.
*   **Mental Accounting:** The tendency to separate money into different mental accounts, leading to irrational decisions (e.g., treating money won differently than money earned).
*   **Social Norms:** Understanding that our behavior is influenced by what we believe others are doing or approve of.
*   **Nudges:** Subtle interventions designed to influence behavior without restricting choice.
*   **Present Bias/Hyperbolic Discounting:** Valuing immediate rewards much more highly than future rewards, even if the future rewards are larger.
*   **Altruism and Fairness:** Recognizing that people are often motivated by factors beyond pure self-interest, such as fairness and a desire to help others.

## Applications

*   **Marketing:** Understanding consumer behavior and designing effective advertising campaigns.
*   **Finance:** Explaining market anomalies and designing investment products.
*   **Public Policy:** Designing policies that encourage socially desirable behaviors (e.g., saving for retirement, making healthier choices).
*   **Health:** Improving health outcomes by understanding behavioral barriers to healthy habits.
*   **Negotiations:** Understanding the biases and motivations of negotiators to reach better agreements.

## Related Fields

*   **Psychology:** Provides the foundation for understanding cognitive processes and biases.
*   **Neuroeconomics:** Uses neuroscience techniques to study the neural mechanisms underlying economic decision-making.
*   **Experimental Economics:** Uses experiments to test economic theories and behavioral assumptions.
*   **Traditional Economics:** While behavioral economics often contrasts with it, understanding classical economic models provides a useful baseline.

## Influential Figures

*   **Daniel Kahneman:** Nobel laureate, known for his work on prospect theory and cognitive biases.
*   **Amos Tversky:** (Deceased) Collaborator with Kahneman on prospect theory.
*   **Richard Thaler:** Nobel laureate, known for his work on nudges and behavioral finance.
*   **Cass Sunstein:** Co-author of "Nudge" and expert on regulatory policy.
*   **Dan Ariely:** Popular author and speaker on behavioral economics.
