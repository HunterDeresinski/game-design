## Core Programming & CS Concepts
**Artifacts students could build:**
- Interactive Story in Twine or Ren’Py → shows branching logic, conditionals, and narrative flow.  
- Text Adventure Game (Python or JavaScript) → demonstrates loops, functions, and state management.  
- Pong or Breakout Clone (JS/Unity) → illustrates event handling, collision detection, and game loops.  
- Inventory System (console-based or with GUI) → arrays, lists, and object-oriented design.  

## Game Design Principles
**Artifacts students could build:**
- Paper Prototype → Digital Prototype → start with a board/card game idea, then implement it digitally. Shows understanding of iteration.  
- Level Design in a Tilemap Editor (e.g., Tiled, Unity) → demonstrates pacing, difficulty curves, and environment storytelling.  
- Balancing Spreadsheet → students tune variables (e.g., enemy health, damage, XP gain) to show math + design balance.  
- Game Feel Demo → a simple “jump” mechanic with variable gravity/acceleration settings to explore juice and player feedback.  

## Visual & Creative Skills
**Artifacts students could build:**
- Sprite Sheet & Simple Animation → using Aseprite (My personal), Piskel, or Photoshop → demonstrates asset pipeline basics.  
- Custom Character in Unity with movement animations (idle, walk, jump).  
- Parallax Background Demo → a short scrolling scene showing depth and camera movement.  
- UI Mockup Prototype (Figma/Canva/Unity) → menus, health bars, mini-maps, etc.  

## Systems & Advanced Concepts
**Artifacts students could build:**
- Dialogue System with branching choices (shows data structures, string management, state machines).  
- AI Enemy Behavior (chasing player, patrolling, idle states) → state machines and conditionals.  
- Procedural Level Generator → introduces randomization, algorithms, and replay-ability.  
- Multiplayer Prototype (even very basic) → network sync, client-server logic.  
- Save/Load System → file handling, serialization, and persistence.  

## Showcase & Portfolio Artifacts
- Playable Prototype in Browser (via itch.io) → shareable artifact that shows coding + design.  
- Developer Blog or Video Devlog → reflective learning artifact (why they designed it that way, what they learned).  
- Game Design Document (GDD) → artifact combining writing, design thinking, and planning. 
- Postmortem Writeup → what went wrong, what went right, lessons learned (huge in professional game dev).
