## Convo With Lindsay

**Me:**

I do not want to create a game design major where their only skill is game design. I want it to be well rounded enough that they can do other things. It just so happens they know the most about game design.

I'm not sure that is even possible but I can imagine a world where that can happen.

**Lindsay:** 

I mean, <u>even starting small, at the single class or certificate level</u>, would be a good start
<u>sometimes it is better to ease into it</u>

so it can just be an extra layer on top of our already strong CS program

the other thing that goes into this is a lot of [[10 - Game Design Program/Game Design Degree Market Research\|market research]]; what are other programs doing, what does their course progression look like, are their any industry-specific accreditations or connections that they are able to brag about, that sort of thing

if we are talking for day campus, we'd want to start with what is offered in Missouri

but now that CS is offered online, it would make sense to keep online in mind for this as well
