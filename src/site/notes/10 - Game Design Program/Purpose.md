# Purpose Document: Proposed Game Design and Development Degree

## Introduction
The video game industry is one of the fastest-growing sectors of the global economy, with career opportunities spanning software engineering, interactive media, entertainment, simulation, and education. Universities across Missouri and beyond have recognized this trend, yet the majority of existing programs fall short of balancing **technical rigor** with **design philosophy**.  

Our institution is uniquely positioned to develop a **Game Design and Development degree** that combines our **very strong Computer Science foundation** with courses in **game psychology, design, and creative philosophy**. This program will prepare students not only for specialized careers in the game industry, but also for broader opportunities in computer science and software engineering.

---

## Purpose of the Program
The primary purpose of the Game Design and Development degree is to:
1. **Leverage our existing strengths in Computer Science** to ensure students graduate as highly capable programmers with deep technical knowledge.  
2. **Layer on specialized game design courses** that explore game psychology, narrative design, level design, gamification, and immersion.  
3. **Integrate interdisciplinary collaboration** by connecting Computer Science with Art, Music, Communications, and Psychology.  
4. **Provide industry-relevant experience** through capstone projects, internships, and collaborations with professional game studios.  
5. **Ensure employability and flexibility** by preparing graduates for both game-specific careers and general CS/software roles.

## Why This Program Is Needed
- **Existing peer programs have gaps**:
  - Lindenwood emphasizes design philosophy but lacks CS rigor.  
  - UCM offers strong CS fundamentals but lighter coverage of game psychology and creative aspects.  
  - Webster highlights facilities and partnerships but is weaker in technical programming depth.  
- **Certificate programs** (e.g., Unity-based training courses) provide valuable skills but are short-term, lack accreditation, and do not prepare graduates for the wide range of industry roles.  

Our program can stand out by addressing all of these shortcomings with a **balanced, accredited, and comprehensive approach**.

## Key Features of the Proposed Program
1. **Strong CS Core**
   - Data Structures, Algorithms, Operating Systems, Software Engineering, AI, Networking.
   - Emphasis on industry-standard languages (C++, C#, Python).
   - Systems-level understanding for optimization and engine development.

2. **Game-Specific Courses**
   - Game Psychology and Player Behavior.  
   - Game Design, Narrative Design, and Level Design.  
   - Gamification and Game Ecosystems.  
   - Advanced Game Programming (Unity and Unreal).  

3. **Experiential Learning**
   - Capstone studios where teams design, implement, and publish games.  
   - Internships with game studios and technology companies.  
   - Annual Game Jams and coding competitions hosted on campus.  

4. **Facilities and Technology**
   - Dedicated Game Innovation Lab with VR/AR, motion capture, and advanced rendering tools.  
   - Access to high-performance computing clusters for graphics and AI.  
   - Student publishing pipeline for showcasing games on Steam, itch.io, and consoles.  

5. **Career Preparation**
   - Graduates build professional portfolios throughout their studies.  
   - Career workshops on pitching games, indie entrepreneurship, and industry pipelines.  
   - Hybrid training ensures graduates are prepared for jobs in both **gaming** and **general CS/software engineering**.  

---

## Outcomes
Graduates of the program will:
- Be **proficient programmers** with a strong background in computer science fundamentals.  
- Understand **game design philosophies** that create engaging and meaningful experiences.  
- Have **hands-on experience** publishing games, collaborating with teams, and working with industry partners.  
- Possess versatile skills to succeed in the **gaming industry**, while also remaining competitive in broader **tech and software sectors**.  

---

## Conclusion
By combining the **technical strength of our Computer Science program** with **game-specific philosophy and design courses**, we can create a Game Design and Development degree that not only competes with but **exceeds peer institutions**. This program will produce graduates who are uniquely qualified: **engineers who can design, and designers who can code**.  

The purpose of this degree is to provide students with the skills, knowledge, and experiences they need to thrive in the gaming industry while maintaining the versatility to succeed across the entire technology landscape.
