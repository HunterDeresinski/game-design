## Vision

I envision a program that is built upon a strong programming background. Even deeper than that, built upon a strong CS background.

Similar to how at Columbia College we advise people to get a dual major in CS and Mathematics. I would like the Game Design program to be setup to where — in a similar vein — one could dual major in CS and Game Design by picking up extra classes that lead towards game design. 

I strongly believe that with an excellent background in CS, if an individual has passion and is pointed in the right direction, they will have the ability to become exceptional in game design and development.

Game design is a very complex field for many reasons, the amount of hard skill required to develop a game as a single individual is immense. That being said, disregarding that edge case, I would like to see the program break into the different aspects that are involved, here are those categories and some examples.

## Categories

- **General Design**
    
    - UI & UX principles
        
    - Level design strategies (flow, pacing, world-building)
        
    - Gameplay loop creation and balancing
        
- **Psychology**
    
    - What makes a gameplay loop fun?
        
    - Motivation theory and player engagement
        
    - Flow state and immersion
        
    - Reward systems (extrinsic vs intrinsic)
        
- **Narrative & Storytelling**
    
    - Interactive storytelling techniques
        
    - World-building fundamentals
        
    - Branching narratives and player choice
        
    - Writing for different genres and tones
        
- **Art & Aesthetics**
    
    - Fundamentals of 2D and 3D art
        
    - Visual design for readability and emotion
        
    - Animation principles applied to games
        
    - Collaboration with artists and pipelines
        
- **Audio Design**
    
    - Sound effects and their psychological impact
        
    - Music as mood and narrative reinforcement
        
    - Voice acting, dialogue, and audio pipelines
        
- **Technology & Engineering**
    
    - Game engines (Unity, Unreal, Godot)
        
    - Graphics programming (shaders, rendering pipelines)
        
    - Networking and multiplayer systems
        
    - Performance optimization & memory management
        
- **Production & Collaboration**
    
    - Agile and iterative development for games
        
    - Cross-disciplinary teamwork (programmers, artists, designers)
        
    - Project management tools and pipelines
        
    - Ethics and inclusivity in game development
        
- **Business & Industry Context**
    
    - Monetization models and economics (free-to-play, premium, etc.)
        
    - Marketing and player communities
        
    - Esports, streaming, and modern game ecosystems
        
    - Intellectual property and legal considerations

# Outcome

Through learning all of these topics the hope is that the students have tangible [[10 - Game Design Program/Artifacts\|artifacts]] to build a portfolio of impressive work that demonstrates their knowledge of the topics and skills required to stand out in the work force.
